# Reference
I found this [documentation](https://pyttsx3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) quite helpful for understanding pyttsx3.
<br>
A good overview of PyPDF2 is given on [pythonhosted](https://pythonhosted.org/PyPDF2/). Do check this one out.
<br>
Moreover Programming Hero has a nice video about the same. 
Follow along this video [Don't Buy Audiobooks! ðŸ˜Ž Build Your Own With Just 12 Lines Of Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyZ_5cvrXJI) for better understanding.
